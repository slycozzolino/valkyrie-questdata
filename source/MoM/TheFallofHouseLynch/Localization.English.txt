The doctors were mystified as it slowly consumed his flesh.  I am a man of action and could not sit around and wait for my heir to deteriorate.\nNine months I spent traveling the globe. Searching for a cure. From the depths of the jungles to the wisdom of the orient, I found nothing. I kept searching, deeper and deeper into the lost places of the world and beyond. I witnessed many mysteries and horrors, but the cure still eluded me.\n\nLittle did I know that it was already too late.  Back home, my son passed from this world with no father there to comfort him.\n\nI returned home to my wife Edith, intending to stay for good.  We grieved.  Life slowly returned to normal and I returned to work.  I started up new business ventures and grew my fortune while my soul languished.\n\nThe healing process was not easy, but I found that helping mend Edith's heart helped me ignore my own pain."""

quest.description,"This is a Conversion of the Mansions Of Madness first edition scenario.\n\nYou have been hired to investigate Walter Lynch.  A once great man who had become increasingly unpredictable.  What dark horrors has he uncovered?  Are you able to discover the truth, or will you me nothing more than another pawn in some greater plan?\n\nNote that no evidence is provided in this scenario, as such insanity conditions which rely on evidence should not be used."
