She was about to phone to police when a gentleman approached the girl and shooed off the stranger. She felt relieved as he continued to walk with her. She described the man as an older gentleman, and probably well off based on the nice suit and shoes he was wearing"".\n""Friday October 28th, Today I return to the Mrs. Hudson's house to surveil the street corner where Cynthia was last seen, hoping she can help identify the man that walked with her. After several hours she finally points out a man she believes to be the same person. 8:22 PM, I have followed this gentleman for several blocks and it seems like he is headed to the market. This seems odd as the market is typically closed at this late an hour. I should probably get closer to see what he is doing""."
